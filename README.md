# Lung-Cancer-Detection-Using-CNN-Model-Machine-Learning-
🧠 Lung Cancer Detection Using CNN
This project leverages deep learning to classify lung cancer histopathological images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It utilizes the LC25000 dataset, comprising 25,000 high-resolution images across five classes, including lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and benign lung tissue.​
